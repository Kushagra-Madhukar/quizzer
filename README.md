# Welcome!

This project was made by me to better understand working with dependent api's and api's in general along with honing my ReactJS skills by managing complex states in between the pages, this was the project which also made me realise the power of css grid in comparision to css flex, and thus will be using it more and more in the coming projects.

1. THis project uses 2 different api's one to fetch the quiz questions and the second one to get corresponding matching images for the question category keyword.
2. Have used grid layout for structuring the app
3. The quiz is scored with marks alloted to each question for both correct and incorrect response you have to complete the quiz in a given interval of time.
